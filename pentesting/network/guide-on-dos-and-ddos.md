{% hint style="danger" %}
Disclaimer: This guide is meant for educational purposes only to understand how attacks work and how to defend against them. Unauthorized attacks on real systems are illegal.
{% endhint %}



## 1. Understanding DoS & DDoS What is a DoS Attack?&#x20;

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is when an attacker floods a target system (server, website, or network) with too much traffic or resource requests, making it slow or completely unavailable.

**What is a DDoS Attack?**&#x20;

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more powerful version of DoS because it uses multiple machines (botnets or compromised systems) to flood the target.



## 2. Requirements for DoS/DDoS Attacks&#x20;

To simulate or test DoS/DDoS (on legal test environments), you‚Äôll need:

A. Tools for DoS:

hping3 (TCP/UDP flood) LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon) Slowloris (HTTP exhaustion attack) GoldenEye (HTTP DoS attack) Xerxes (Layer 7 attack used by Anonymous)&#x20;

B. Tools for DDoS:

&#x20;Metasploit Auxiliary Modules Mirai Botnet (for IoT-based attacks, research purpose only) Botnets (controlled through C2 servers, not recommended for ethical use) Stresser/Booter Services (many are illegal but exist on the dark web)&#x20;

C. System Setup:

A Linux system (Kali, Parrot, or Ubuntu)&#x20;

A test server (self-hosted or legal target like a CTF challenge)&#x20;

VPN or proxy chains (for anonymity if testing in a closed environment)&#x20;



## 3. How DoS/DDoS Attacks Are Done (A to Z Guide)&#x20;

**Step 1:** Selecting a Target Targets can be web servers, APIs, networks, or applications. In real-world scenarios, attackers often scan websites using reconnaissance tools (Nmap, Shodan, etc.) to find weak targets.&#x20;

Step 2: Choosing the Right Attack.



## 3. Types of DoS/DDoS attacks:

üîπ **Layer 3 (Network Layer Attacks):**

* **SYN Flood:** Overloads a server‚Äôs connection requests.&#x20;
* **UDP Flood:** Sends a large number of UDP packets to exhaust server resources.&#x20;
* **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)**: Overwhelms a target with ping requests.&#x20;

üîπ **Layer 4 (Transport Layer Attacks)**&#x20;

* **hping3 UDP/TCP flood:** Sends thousands of packets per second.&#x20;
* **ACK Flood**: Disrupts firewalls by flooding acknowledgment packets.&#x20;

üîπ **Layer 7 (Application Layer Attacks)**&#x20;

* **Slowloris Attack:** Opens multiple HTTP connections and never closes them.&#x20;
* **HTTP POST/GET Flood:** Sends thousands of fake HTTP requests to overwhelm a web server.&#x20;



## 4. Practical Attack Demonstration:

**4.1 DoS Attack Using hping3:** `hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 <target_ip>`

**üìå Explanation:**

1. **-S** ‚Üí Sends SYN packets.&#x20;
2. **--flood** ‚Üí Sends packets as fast as possible.&#x20;
3. **-V** ‚Üí Verbose mode (shows output).&#x20;
4. **-p 80** ‚Üí Targets port 80 (HTTP).&#x20;

**üî• Impact:**&#x20;

* This attack overwhelms the target‚Äôs web server, making it slow or unresponsive.



**4.2 DDoS Attack Using LOIC (Windows/Linux)**&#x20;

1. Download LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon).&#x20;
2. Enter the Target IP or website URL.&#x20;
3. Select Attack Mode (TCP, UDP, or HTTP flood).&#x20;
4. Set Thread Count (Higher = More powerful attack).&#x20;
5. Start Attack.&#x20;

**üî• Impact:**&#x20;

* If multiple users launch LOIC on the same target, it acts as a DDoS attack (easier to track, though).



**4.3 Slowloris Attack (Layer 7 DoS):**&#x20;

`git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris.git`&#x20;

`cd slowloris`&#x20;

`python3 slowloris.py --sockets 500`&#x20;

**üìå Explanation:**

This script opens many half-connections to the target and never closes them. The server crashes because it runs out of connections.&#x20;

**üî• Impact:**&#x20;

* Works best against Apache, Nginx, and IIS servers.



**4.4 DDoS Using a Botnet (Mirai Example)**&#x20;

1. Compromise IoT devices (Cameras, Routers, etc.).&#x20;
2. Inject malware to turn them into bots.&#x20;
3. Send commands from a C2 Server to launch DDoS floods.&#x20;
4. Target gets hit from thousands of infected machines.&#x20;

**üî• Impact:**&#x20;

* This is the most powerful form of DDoS, often used in real-world cyberattacks.



## 5. Defending Against DoS/DDoS&#x20;

If you're hosting a website or server, you can prevent DoS/DDoS attacks using:

üîπ Firewall Rules: Block unusual traffic patterns.&#x20;

üîπ Rate Limiting: Limits the number of requests per second from a single IP.&#x20;

üîπ Cloudflare or AWS Shield: Protects against Layer 7 attacks.&#x20;

üîπ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Detects attack patterns.&#x20;

üîπ Blackhole Routing: Drops traffic when a DDoS is detected.&#x20;

üîπ Using CDN Services: Like Cloudflare, Akamai, or Fastly to absorb DDoS.



## 6. Ethical Usage & Legal Considerations&#x20;

**‚úÖ When DoS/DDoS is Legal:**

* Testing your own server.&#x20;
* Testing inside a controlled lab environment.&#x20;
* With written permission from an organization.&#x20;

**‚ùå When DoS/DDoS is Illegal:**

* Attacking someone else's server without consent.&#x20;
* Disrupting government, banking, or public services.&#x20;
* Using botnets to attack websites.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
üí° **Consequences:** Unauthorized DoS/DDoS attacks can lead to prison time (5-20 years), huge fines, and lifetime bans from using the internet in some countries.
{% endhint %}

## 7. Conclusions

1. DoS = Single machine attack.&#x20;
2. DDoS = Multiple machines (botnets).&#x20;
3. Attacks can be done using SYN Floods, UDP Floods, HTTP Floods, Slowloris, etc.&#x20;
4. Defenses include firewalls, rate limiting, CDNs, and DDoS protection services.
