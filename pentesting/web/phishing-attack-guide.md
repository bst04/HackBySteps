# Phishing Attack Guide

### **1. Introduction**

Phishing is a cyber attack where an attacker tricks victims into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data by impersonating a trusted entity. This guide will cover different phishing techniques, setting up test environments, executing attacks, and defensive measures.

### **2. Types of Phishing Attacks**

* **Email Phishing** – Mass emails that mimic legitimate organizations to trick users into clicking malicious links.
* **Spear Phishing** – Targeted attacks on specific individuals or organizations using personalized content.
* **Whaling** – Phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals like executives or government officials.
* **Smishing** – SMS-based phishing where fake messages lure users into revealing information.
* **Vishing** – Voice-based phishing where attackers call victims, pretending to be trusted sources.
* **Clone Phishing** – Copying a legitimate email, replacing links/attachments with malicious ones.
* **Evilginx (Adversary-in-the-Middle)** – Bypassing MFA using reverse proxy phishing.

***

### **3. Setting Up a Phishing Campaign (Test Environment)**

#### **Tools Required:**

* **Gophish** – Open-source phishing framework.
* **Evilginx** – MITM framework for stealing session tokens.
* **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)** – Automates phishing attacks.
* **Phishery** – Generates Office documents for credential harvesting.
* **Custom Python scripts** – For email automation and payloads.

#### **Steps:**

1.  **Install Gophish** (For email-based phishing)

    ```bash
    wget https://getgophish.com/linux/amd64/gophish.zip
    unzip gophish.zip && cd gophish
    ./gophish
    ```

    * Configure SMTP settings to send phishing emails.
    * Create a phishing template and launch a campaign.



1.  **Set up Evilginx** (For MFA bypass)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
    cd evilginx2 && make && sudo ./bin/evilginx
    ```

    * Set up a fake login page.
    * Capture session tokens from users.



1.  **Using SET for phishing emails**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install setoolkit
    setoolkit
    ```

    * Navigate to "Social Engineering Attacks" → "Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors"
    * Craft and send a malicious email.

***

### **4. Execution: Launching a Phishing Attack (Simulated)**

#### **Example: Email Phishing with Gophish**

* Create a fake login page (clone a real one with HTTrack or manually).
* Embed the link in an email with a believable pretext.
* Send to targets and track interactions.

#### **Example: MFA Bypass with Evilginx**

* Register a lookalike domain (e.g., **g00gle.com** instead of **google.com**).
* Set up Evilginx to proxy requests to the real site.
* Capture session cookies and replay them to bypass MFA.

***

### **5. Post-Attack Actions**

* **Credential Harvesting** – Store stolen credentials securely for testing purposes.
* **Session Hijacking** – Use captured tokens to access accounts without passwords.
* **Pivoting** – Leverage compromised accounts for further attacks.
* **Persistence** – Set up backdoors or secondary access points.

***

### **6. Detection & Defense Against Phishing**

#### **Preventative Measures:**

* Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** (preferably hardware keys).
* Train employees on **phishing awareness**.
* Implement **email filtering** (DMARC, SPF, DKIM).
* Use **anti-phishing tools** like PhishTank and VirusTotal.
* Monitor network traffic for **anomalous login attempts**.

#### **Incident Response:**

* Reset passwords immediately after detecting a phishing attempt.
* Invalidate compromised **session tokens**.
* Report phishing domains to authorities (Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, etc.).
* Conduct forensic analysis to trace attacker methods.

***

### **7. Practice Tasks**

1. Set up **Gophish** and create a phishing email targeting a test user.
2. Clone a legitimate login page and host it on a local server.
3. Use **Evilginx** to intercept session cookies in a test environment.
4. Test detection techniques by monitoring logs and analyzing phishing attempts.
5. Create awareness materials or training for employees to recognize phishing.

### **Final Notes**

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors. Learning how it works strengthens both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills. Always ensure phishing tests are conducted **ethically and legally** in controlled environments.
